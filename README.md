Locking mechanisms to avoid race condition in DB :

1) High contention: Use pessimistic locking, advisory locks, or distributed locks.
2) Low contention: Use optimistic locking or timestamp-based locking.
3) Distributed systems: Use Redis, consensus algorithms, or queue-based processing.
4) Scalability: Consider sharding or MVCC.
